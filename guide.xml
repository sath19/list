    <desc lang="en">Dallas Campbell and Ellie Harrison present the first of two programmes in which they embark on the ultimate treasure hunt, searching the globe to uncover its extraordinary riches, from natural gems to precious metals - and more besides. Dallas begins his search Down Under, free-diving for lustrous pearls in the waters around north-west Australia and seeking out diamonds from the bottom of the ocean. He also learns about opal mining in one of the most hostile places on Earth and, together with Ellie, reveals how ambergris, a substance that starts life in a sperm whale's stomach, can prove an expensive ingredient in perfume. Plus, how one of the largest and most unusual treasures has helped solve a 67-million-year-old puzzle.(n)</desc>

The facility was built in 1852 and initially housed both male and female prisoners. However, in 1902 it became a female-only jail and had a new gallows installed, with its first victims being serial baby killers Amelia Sach and Annie Walters. Suffragettes imprisoned there were treated as common criminals and when some of them began hunger strikes, the regime's response was brutal. The programme ends by taking a look at the prison during the Second World War and up to 1948.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In one of the biggest engineering projects of the Middle Ages, Salisbury Cathedral was moved from a wind-blasted Iron Age hill fort to its current location - a feat accomplished in just 38 years, helping establish the Wiltshire city in the process. A place of both ancient tradition and home to one of the country's oldest choirs, Tony witnesses the ritual of inducting a new chorister and sees the oldest working clock in the world. The presenter also reflects on the cathedral's role in a clandestine operation that helped turn the tide of the Second World War.(n)</desc>
