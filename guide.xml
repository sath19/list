    <title lang="en">The No 5 War</title>
    <desc lang="en">The story, both thrilling and dark, of the world's most famous perfume. In 1921, Coco Chanel's revolutionary perfume concept was as audacious as her outlandish designer clothing. At its launch it was an instant hit. From the 1920s to the 1940s the Number 5 brand was at the centre of a war between the celebrated designer and her entrepreneurial business partners, the Wertheimer Brothers. During the Second World War, with the help of her high-ranking Nazi lover, Coco Chanel attempted to oust her Jewish partners - who had fled German occupied France and were operating the business from New Jersey - to take control of the highly lucrative business.(n)</desc>

So catchy that it instantly gets stuck in Harvey P Dull's head and it's really getting on his nerves. Furgus suggests that he takes a walk in the garden to clear his head, but that doesn't work. Cookie Monster tries singing him a new song, the Cookie Cookie Yum Yum song but that doesn't work either. Elmo suggests that he tries counting, which works for a little while, but then the song comes back into his head! But the Furchester's can solve any problem and when it seems that Harvey can't take it anymore; Funella announces that she has finished the welcome song! Phoebe gets a monster idea: If they sing the song all the way to the end, then it might end in Harvey's head too. Everyone in the hotel sings the song and at the end Harvey is cured!(n)</desc>
